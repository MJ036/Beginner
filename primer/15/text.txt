Alice Emma has long flowing red hair.
Her Daddy says when the wind blows
through her hair, i t looks almost alive,
like a fiery bird in flight.
A beautiful fiery bird , he tell sher,
magical but untamed.
"Daddy, shush, there is no such thing,"
she tells him, at the same time wanting
him to tell her more.
Shyly, she asks, "I mean, Daddy, is there?"
